      rOpenSci: Invitation to review the package coolr
      
      Dear Jane Smith,
      
      I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to ask if you would be willing to review a package for rOpenSci. rOpenSci conducts peer review of R packages contributed to our collection in a manner similar to journals.
      
      The package coolr, by John Doe, does cool things in R. You can find its GitHub repo at https://github.com/jhondoe/coolr and its open-review issue at https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/000. If you accept, note that we ask reviewers to complete reviews in three weeks. (We've found it takes a similar amount of time to review a package as an academic paper.)
      
      Our [reviewers guide] details what we look for in a package review, and includes links to example reviews. Our standards are detailed in our [packaging guide], and we provide a reviewer [template] for you to use. Please make sure you do not have a [conflict of interest] preventing you from reviewing this package. If you have questions or feedback, feel free to ask me or post to the [rOpenSci forum].
      
      Are you able to review? I think you would be a great reviewer because of your experience developing cool things. If I don't hear from you within a week, I will assume you are unavailable.
      
      Thank you for your time.
      
      Sincerely,
      Mauro Lepore
